# Challenges Representation on GeM
Bidders whose bids have been disqualified in technical evaluation may review the reason(s) for rejection by the Buyer and raise a **one-time representation** to challenge the rejection for disqualification within 48 hours after technical evaluation is completed.

Buyer shall respond to all such representations before proceeding with the Financial Bid Opening.

## Steps
Log in to your GeM Seller Account and search for a bid in which you are disqualified by the buyer.
From here, you can view the rejection reason and submit a one-time representation.

## Response
Once the buyer replies to your representation, you will get an email like this.

[From the technical status](technical-status) of the bid, you can now see whether the buyer accepted your technical bid or not.
