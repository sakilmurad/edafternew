# Price Justification on GeM
It is not uncommon for sellers to quote rates that cannot be accepted by buyers. In those cases, GeM has introduced a Price Justification window for unworkable L1.

Buyers may ask for **price justification** from sellers for their quoted price. A price justification request may be sent to sellers via email.
