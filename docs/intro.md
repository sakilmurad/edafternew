## Why GeM Portal?
In the last 6 years, GeM has become increasingly popular. The Government of India has made the entry "32. Development, operation and maintenance of the National Public Procurement Portal—Government e Marketplace". The purchases through GeM by Government users have been authorized and made mandatory by the Ministry of Finance by adding a new Rule No. 149 in the General Financial Rules, 2017.

Now everyone is moving to GeM for procurement. If a seller wants to sell their products or services to government agencies, they must join the GeM Portal.
