# Accept Orders on GeM
GeM has introduced an auto approval system for direct orders. Any direct order placed on GeM will be auto accepted except those:
1. If an order is placed by a `Red Flagged` Buyer
2. If the order is freight intensive

Once you get an order from the above mentioned scenario, you will get an alert email about that order as follows:

![Order Mail](/img/doc/order-mail.jpg)

You need to accept or decline the order within 120 hours (5 days). If you are unable to take any action in respect of that order, the system will automatically accept that order.

## Steps
1. Log in to the GeM Seller Account
