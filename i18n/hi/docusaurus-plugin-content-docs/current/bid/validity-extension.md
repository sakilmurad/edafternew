# Validity Extension of GeM Bid
Bid Offer Validity is the period during which the Seller Offer is valid from the Bid End Date. The buyer needs to award the order within the Bid Offer Validity Period. If he is unable to do so, he must request an extension of bid validity from the seller. The seller has to accept/reject the offer validity request within 5 days from the date it was initiated.
