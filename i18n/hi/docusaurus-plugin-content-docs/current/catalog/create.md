# Catalog Creation on GeM
A seller must have at least one catalog in that category in order to participate in the bid. Let's see how sellers can add new catalogs to the GeM Platform.

There are two types of catalogs that can be listed on the platform.
1. **Products**
2. **Services**

Let's learn both in detail.
## Add a new product
Before adding a new product, you must first identify the category of your product. [This tutorial](categories) can help you get one.

Once you have identified the category, go to `Catalogue > Products > Add New Offering`
Search for the identified category in the left search bar and click on the resulting category.

There are a total of 5 steps you need to follow in order to create a new product catalog on GeM.

1. **GENERAL INFORMATION**: This includes brand name, catalog clone option, and golden parameters of the category.
